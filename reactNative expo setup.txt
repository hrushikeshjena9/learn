To set up an Expo project for React Native with JavaScript, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Node.js
First, make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Install Expo CLI
Next, install the **Expo CLI** globally. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### 3. Create a New Expo Project
To create a new Expo project, run:
```bash
expo init my-new-project
```
Replace `my-new-project` with your desired project name. You'll be prompted to choose a template. For a simple JavaScript setup, choose the "blank" template.

### 4. Navigate to Your Project Folder
Change your working directory to the newly created project:
```bash
cd my-new-project
```

### 5. Start the Expo Development Server
Now, start the Expo development server:
```bash
expo start
```
This will open the Expo Developer Tools in your browser. You can scan the QR code with the **Expo Go app** on your phone (available on iOS and Android) to view your project in the mobile app, or you can use an emulator/simulator.

### 6. Modify Your Project Files
In the project folder, you'll find the main app file is `App.js`. You can start editing this file to develop your app.

For example, a simple `App.js` might look like this:
```js
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Hello, Expo React Native!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
});
```

### 7. Additional Steps (Optional)
If you want to install additional dependencies, you can do so using `expo install` or `npm install`. For example:
```bash
expo install react-navigation react-navigation-stack
```

### 8. Build and Publish Your App
Once you're ready, you can build and publish your app using the following Expo commands:
```bash
expo build:android  # For Android
expo build:ios      # For iOS (requires a macOS machine)
```

This setup will get you started with a React Native project using Expo!
